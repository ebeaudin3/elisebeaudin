  <h1>THE PEOPLE AND THE XIOZOMES</h1>
  <p class="author-credit">Written by Élise Beaudin</p>
  <p>
  There was a ship, there was a People, there was a blue-green ocean. The blue-green ocean sometimes lit sometimes not, by the multitude of shiny crystals with tiny legs, called the Xiozomes. The People was afraid of them and them was afraid of the People. The only difference being that one ate the other. Catching the tiny-legged Xiozomes was not an easy endeavor. Twenty or more was needed, or Twenty pairs of lungs were needed. Every time the People went deep water harvesting, the People lost Twenty of theirs, in the hope of getting thousands of the Xiozomes, which could feed many more generations to come of the People. This is the story of the venture of Twenty two-legged two-lunged of the People who were chosen to complete the 2307th feeding cycle. The day of departure was a day like all others. No friends of family came to the dock, no waving, no crying. The Twenty stepped foot on the ship, the ship crew stood tall and well-dressed. They saluted and bowed. The ropes were cut, thrown in the water, the voyage started. Excitement was sparse. It was known that this was a one-way venture. The grey-haired chanted and the ship sailed off, onto the horizon. The Twenty were sorted into pairs, each pair had a right-handed and left-handed. The People loved symmetry. The pairs went to their assigned room. In front of each door was a door mat on which one could read a sequence of numbers. Those numbers had no meaning. The room consisted of a single bed, for only one half of the pair would sleep at a time. The pairs entered their room and found in the closet their new and final dress. White was the color, for white was the color of war. The right-handed went to sleep, the other half went down to the deck. It was nighttime. It was always nighttime at sea. It was told the sea Sun had frozen at the sight of the Xiozomes. The now Tens stood around and ten hot hard hats were passed around. Tonight, the blue-green ocean was not bright. Tomorrow, maybe. It was time to read the blue-green ocean. Ocean reading was a skill only acquired by certain. All of the Twenty knew. The Ten hot hard hatted kneeled down near the end of the deck, facing the dark, and stretched their arms. The ship tilted, until twenty hands touched the water. They all started screaming, the frequency was 2410Hz. The water was colder than they were told. “My hands are not warm enough”, one said. “The water is too cold”, one said. “It is both”, one said. They studied the water until none could feel their bones. The ship tilted back down, the hands were out of the freezing liquid. The blue-green ocean was glowing. A hello hello from the Xiozomes. Starving, the left-handed went to their room, woke up the other half, touched their face with their hands. All eyes turned red, all skin turned blue. It was time, they said, for them to sleep. They went to bed. The new Ten went down to the deck. They repeated the process, 27 times, weeks on. Then, the pace was slower, much much slower, the fear of fearing was soaring. One day the water turned to light, it was time for the crime. Sea moss sea chlog sea reng sea mantr sea nak and sea sass came to the surface to watch. The Twenty Blue jumped together in the bright blue-green ocean and held hands in a circle. A pentagon bubble formed in the middle, a shape so unique no one had seen it before. The bubble pulled the Twenty down. Down to more meters than they learned to count. The darkness felt light. The forty lungs were breathing all at once, hhhaaa, aaahhh. With the pressure, their legs elongated, their arms elongated, their neck elongated. A cloud of Xiozomes appeared above their heads. Forty red eyes stared at thousands of Xiozomes. The Xiozomes were much smaller than they were told. The polygon bubble absorbed the Xiosomes. All 12,346 of them. The Xiozome bubble resurfaced, the ship crew used nets to harvest the Xiozomes. The Twenty were no longer, but the People lived.
