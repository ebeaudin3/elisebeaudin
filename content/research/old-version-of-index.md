<!-- Marine Heatwaves -->

{{< topic image="/img/coral-bleaching.jpeg" title="Marine Heatwaves">}}

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged periods of anomalously high sea surface temperatures that persist for days to months and can span thousands of kilometers. They result from a combination of oceanic and atmospheric processes, including persistent anomalous low-pressure conditions, reduced vertical mixing, or anomalous heat advection.

MHWs significantly disrupt marine ecosystems, causing coral bleaching, shifts in ecosystem distributions, and sometimes fisheries collapses. As anthropogenic climate change increases background ocean temperatures, MHWs are becoming more frequent, intense, and longer-lasting, which raises concerns for ocean resilience and climate adaptation.

<!-- Submesoscale Dynamics -->

{{< topic image="/img/submesoscale.png" title="Submesoscale Dynamics" >}}

Submesoscale dynamics are ocean motions on scales of 1–10 kilometers and last hours to days. They play a crucial role in shaping the surface distribution of phytoplankton. These processes, such as fronts, eddies and filaments, enhance vertical nutrient transport and create sharp gradients in physical properties. By injecting nutrients into the sunlit surface layer or concentrating biomass, submesoscale flows can generate intense, patchy blooms of phytoplankton. Their transient and localized nature adds complexity to ocean productivity and carbon cycling, making them a key target in high-resolution oceanographic studies.

<!-- Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction Impacts Landfall Precipitation -->

{{< topic image="/img/precip.png" title="Coastal Rainfall">}}

Predicting rainfall along the U.S. West Coast is critical for managing water resources and supporting agriculture. While large-scale atmospheric circulation (e.g., atmospheric rivers) is the primary driver of precipitation, sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Northeast Pacific also play a significant role. Coastal SSTs can feedback onto the atmosphere mainly due to wind-driven changes in water vapor transport toward or away from the coast. Warmer SST can enhance rainfall, especially in Northern and Central California during winter and in Baja California during summer, whereas cooler SSTs tend to suppress it.
